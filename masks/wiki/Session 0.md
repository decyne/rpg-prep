# When our team first came together
* Team knew each other because they were the only ones to stay back and fight
  * Bonded when they were punished afterwards
* Dangerous enemy:
* Fire Elemental summoned by someone in school through sorcery
* On basketball court
* Moss tried to take it on, but couldn't do it on her own
* Faux lured elemental into science building by using illusions of students
* Dust held it into science building with telekenises
* Moss buried elemental with science building by using tree roots to structurally collapse
* Rules broken:
  * Were meant to evacuate the school and not fight
  * School's rules
  * Teachers saw students running into building, but they were just illusions
* High cost:
  * Destroying School
  * Were playing out their superhero fantasy
* Science co-ordinator was pissed off [Mrs Jeffries](Mrs Jeffries)

# Influence
* Everyone has influence over everyone, except Faux does not have influence over Moss
